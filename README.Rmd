[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

This package is an example of how to provide an analysis workflow using the `drake` package as an R package/research compendium. The idea is to include both the analysis directory strucure, including all inputs needed to reproduce the analysis as well as all generated outputs, and the `.drake` directory with the package. Using included functions, the user can easily reproduce the included analysis and inspect the analysis workflow (more details on how to do so are given in the vignette and/or on the `pkgdown` [site](https://januz.github.io/drakepkg/)).

## Installation

Install the package using 

```
# without vignette
devtools::install_github("januz/drakepkg")

# with vignette
devtools::install_github("januz/drakepkg", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Simulating computational environment using Docker

To reproduce the analysis in the exact computational environment used to create it by the original authors, use one of the following options:

1. run the included Docker container from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/januzzz/drakepkg/)
2. run the Docker container on BinderHub: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/januz/drakepkg/master?urlpath=rstudio)
